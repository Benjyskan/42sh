DOES NOT SUPPORT UNICODE OR TABS;

Each lines has a struct corresponding to it.
The input_cmd is a list of those structs.

A chained list of cmd_line structs. Doubly linked (move up and down);
Data we need :
	window size;
	starting position
	char *txt;
	current_malloc_size;
	current_data_size;
	line_pointer;
	nb_lines;

When writing on a cmd_line : normal rules, except when printing a
newline (position == ws->columns)
nb_lines = ft_strlen(cmd_line) / ws->columns
current_cursor_pos.row = cmd_line.start_pos.row + (line_pointer / ws->columns)
current_cursor_pos.columns = line_pointer % ws->columns;
case where start pos is before terminal (negative)
prompt_size


util function to place cursor according to line_pointer
