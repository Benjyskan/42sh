everytime we press enter, new prompt node.
node has : prompt_struct, start_pos, relative_pos, text struct, *window struct, *hist_lst, next and prev.

prompt_struct : char * prompt and size_t size;
txt struct : malloc_size, data_size, tracker;

methods :
	- get_nb_lines (relative_pos - start_pos)
	- go_back_to_start (go up get_nb_lines, and go to start of line ?)

on signal:
	go to the top; (while prev : go back_to_start)
	rewrite everything; (while next: write_everything)

scroll :
	- update all pos;

history : rewrite switch st_cmd function

Both functions need to update relative_pos matrix !

===
write_everything -> writes everything, updates positions
write_from_here -> writes everything starting from here
append_txt -> appends a string to txt, updating malloc, data_size and tracker

need_to_scroll -> determines if we need to scroll.
yes -> write_everything
